🚀 Building a Smarter AI Chatbot with RAG & AI Agents! 🤖📚

I recently built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with AI agents that enhances chatbot responses by intelligently fetching information from a vector database and leveraging an LLM only when necessary. The goal? Minimize API calls, improve efficiency, and make the chatbot more context-aware over time!

🔹 How It Works
✅ User asks a question.
✅ The chatbot checks the vector database for a similar query.
✅ If a relevant answer is found, it retrieves and responds immediately.
✅ If no similar answer exists, it queries an LLM, generates a response, and stores it for future use.
✅ If the query involves "research," it performs a web search (via Tavily) and updates the vector DB with the latest insights!

🔹 Key Features
🔹 Memory-Augmented AI Agent – Learns from past interactions.
🔹 Semantic Search – Retrieves similar responses, not just exact matches.
🔹 LLM Optimization – Reduces unnecessary API calls.
🔹 Web Research Integration – Ensures up-to-date information when required.

This system continuously improves and makes AI-driven chatbots more efficient, cost-effective, and context-aware.

Would love to hear your thoughts! Have you worked with RAG-based AI agents before? Let’s discuss! 🚀
