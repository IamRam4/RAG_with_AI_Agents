## Here using RAG as a kind of cache. So, the response time will be reduced. If the same query has been asked again.
ðŸš€ Building a Smarter AI Chatbot with RAG & AI Agents! ðŸ¤–ðŸ“š

I recently built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with AI agents that enhances chatbot responses by intelligently fetching information from a vector database and leveraging an LLM only when necessary. The goal? Minimize API calls, improve efficiency, and make the chatbot more context-aware over time!

ðŸ”¹ How It Works
âœ… User asks a question.
âœ… The chatbot checks the vector database for a similar query.
âœ… If a relevant answer is found, it retrieves and responds immediately.
âœ… If no similar answer exists, it queries an LLM, generates a response, and stores it for future use.
âœ… If the query involves "research," it performs a web search (via Tavily) and updates the vector DB with the latest insights!

ðŸ”¹ Key Features
ðŸ”¹ Memory-Augmented AI Agent â€“ Learns from past interactions.
ðŸ”¹ Semantic Search â€“ Retrieves similar responses, not just exact matches.
ðŸ”¹ LLM Optimization â€“ Reduces unnecessary API calls.
ðŸ”¹ Web Research Integration â€“ Ensures up-to-date information when required.

This system continuously improves and makes AI-driven chatbots more efficient, cost-effective, and context-aware.
